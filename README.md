# Welcome to Setting Up your Own Python Functions Manual!

This manual is intended to provide readers a quick start to setting up their very own Python functions to reduce the amount of time on their own commonly repetitive tasks.

This guide is geared more towards data analysts. A common tasks for most analysts is working with the same dataset(s), whether its the same set of "sales" or "customers" data to answer analytical questions from various business stakeholders. This kind of busy-work could involve the same tedious processes an analyst needs to do before they can summarize their data.

This guide, with simple examples will (hopefully) provide a starting ground for the following:
- How to setup your own package
- A quick setup to automatically reading in files using strings
- Running aggregations on prepared datasets
- Exporting your results into csv files

Some practical ideas that users can create, including ones that go beyond this guide, could be the following:
- Load common files to automatically clean and prep into a ready-to-use dataframe
- Automatically prepare reports with a single function
- Run commonly used filters or slices on a dataframe (e.g. by dates, columns names, certain strings)
- Create, update and replace csv files
